# ch4t
A shitty socket-based communication that uses a server to establish the connection between two clients, which have to be using the same key for message encryption.


USAGE: 

Change the ip and port in the files. Also, check the encryption key.

The server-side script must be running and then two clients should connect using the client-side version.
