A shitty socket-based communication that uses a server to establish the connection between two clients, which have to be using the same key for message encryption with SHA-256.


Change the IP, PORT in the code of both sides.

Check for the encryption key.

The server-side script must be running and then two clients should connect using the client-side version.
